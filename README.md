# Password-Generator
This is a simple Python program that generates a random password based on user inputs. The program prompts the user to input the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they would like to include in their password.

The program uses the random library to select random characters from a pre-defined set of letters, symbols, and numbers. The letters are chosen from both upper and lower case alphabets.

The generated password is a combination of letters, symbols, and numbers that are shuffled using the random.shuffle() function. The final output is a strong, randomly generated password.
